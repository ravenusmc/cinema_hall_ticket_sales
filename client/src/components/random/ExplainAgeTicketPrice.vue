        Ok, the graph to the left is not what I thought it would be. I thought that I would get a graph, with some 
        data points and a best fit line. I guess in a way that's what I got. But the data points just didn't come out 
        the way that I thought that they would. Now, at this point, I'll also say that AI suggested making this graph. However, 
        I did start to learn about how I can use linear regression which is actually a new type of graph for me.
